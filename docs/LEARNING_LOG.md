# Learning log

## M0: Plan

- Built: The milestone plan, source notes, risks, and decisions before coding.
- Learned: Missing cash counts must stay unknown, and zero flags cannot prove
  that reconciliation has already run.
- Interview question: Why separate POS records, physical counts, and deposits
  instead of treating them as one total?

## M1: Project foundation

- Built: The installable package, help command, central errors, exact money
  helpers, safe connection helper, tests, and shared project instructions. Saved
  the original brief so future chats retain the exact requirements.
- Learned: `with con:` saves or rolls back a transaction; `closing(con)` closes
  the connection. Money parsing must reject invalid precision before conversion.
- Interview question: Why use integer cents and a strict decimal parser instead
  of floats for cash calculations?

Verified on 2026-10-22 using Python 3.13.5 and SQLite 3.47.1. Development tools
installed for this run: pytest 9.1.1 and Ruff 0.17.1.

| Command or check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `PIP_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/drawercheck-pip-cache .venv/bin/python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'` | PASS: editable installation and development tools installed. The initial sandboxed attempt could not reach the package index; the authorized retry succeeded. |
| `.venv/bin/pytest -q` | PASS: 52 tests, with ResourceWarning and cleanup warnings treated as errors. |
| `.venv/bin/pytest --collect-only -q` | PASS: 52 tests collected. |
| `.venv/bin/ruff check .` | PASS: all checks passed. |
| `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` | PASS: no formatting changes needed. |
| `.venv/bin/drawercheck --help` | PASS: installed console command prints help and exits 0. |
| `.venv/bin/drawercheck --unknown` through a subprocess check | PASS: exits 1, prints the central usage error to stderr, and prints no traceback. |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pip check` | PASS: no broken requirements found. |
| Temporary intentional-leak test, run with `pytest -q -c pyproject.toml` | PASS: the probe confirmed pytest exits 1 with a cleanup warning for the deliberate connection leak. The temporary test was then removed; it is not part of the passing suite. |
| Instruction and source checks | PASS: AGENTS.md is under 150 lines, CLAUDE.md contains only the shared import, the brief is copied unchanged, and the checked source/docs contain neither prohibited punctuation character. |

The milestone's test suite checks exact and invalid money values, SQLite integer
limits, decimal-context independence, connection closure, commit/rollback,
foreign keys on reopened connections, old SQLite rejection, and CLI help/errors.
Database tables for the application, imports, reconciliation, and reports are
scheduled for later milestones. GitHub CI and the Python version matrix are
scheduled for M6; those checks have not been claimed as passing here.

Next milestone: **M2**, after the user says **next**.

## Scope update: Public frontend (2026-10-22)

- Built: Updated the plan for a polished public app where visitors can upload
  synthetic CSVs, run checks, inspect results, and download reports. Added
  `docs/WEB_PLAN.md` and recorded the original brief's scope amendment.
- Learned: A static report host cannot execute the Python reconciliation
  workflow. The proposed Flask layer can reuse the core while keeping each
  visitor's run in a separate temporary workspace.
- Interview question: How can a command-line tool and public website share
  calculations while keeping different visitors' data separate?

This is a documentation-only scope update. M7/M8 implementation follows the
core milestones; M2 remains the next build milestone. No web packages have been
installed. Verification is document consistency, instruction length, and
`git diff --check`; the application test results above remain the M1 results.
